# Steam Share Master - SSM

## 📝 Description
Steam Share Master (SSM) is a portable Windows software coded in Python that isolates Steam from the internet on demand while keeping your PC online.  
It lets you play Steam Family Sharing games simultaneously, so you and your family members can enjoy the same game without interruptions.  
SSM has NO affiliation with Steam.  
Steam is a trademark of Valve Corporation.

## 🚀 Features
- Keep Steam isolated from the network without disconnecting from the internet
- Play shared family games simultaneously
- Simple and intuitive interface using PyQt6
- Lightweight and easy to set up

## 📥 Installation
1. Unzip and store the folder anywhere you want
2. Click on the `.exe` file to launch the program  
   *When the program is launched, pin it to your taskbar for quicker access in the future.*

## 🛠 Usage
1. Launch Steam Share Master
2. Locate your `Steam.exe` file if it's not located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steam.exe` (optional)
3. Click on **Block Steam** to isolate Steam from the network if someone from your Steam Family is currently playing a game you want to play
4. Click on **Unblock Steam** to reconnect Steam to the network when you're done playing  

   **DISCLAIMER:** You must deactivate Steam Cloud on the game you want to play after blocking Steam, but don't worry—Steam Cloud saves will resynchronize and reactivate by itself after unblocking Steam.
